Members of the OASIS [Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Technical
Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2)
use this GitHub repository as part of the [TC's chartered
work](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).
Contributors must be Members of the TC. Work is governed by the
OASIS policies and is not done under typical open source
licensing. For more details, see the

## :blue_book: _Information Modeling with JADN_ :blue_book:

The [JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)
specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/jadn-v1.0.html)
defines an information modeling (IM) language by specifying a
vocabulary to describe the meaning of structured data, to provide
hints for user interfaces working with structured data, and to
make assertions about what a valid instance must look like. This
respository hosts a companion [OASIS Committee
Note](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dCommitteeNote)
that provides context and explanatory material to assist with
applying JADN in practice.

The Published branch of this repository contains the
OASIS-published CN01 version of this document and associated
files. Markdown, HTML, and PDF versions are provided and are
identical to the versions available from OASIS.

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Repository Organization :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty.
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/working/imjadn-v1.0-cn02.md) of this work product.

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).


### :left_speech_bubble: Description :left_speech_bubble:

Information models (IMs) are used to define and generate physical
data models, validate information instances, and enable lossless
translation across data formats. JSON Abstract Data Notation
(JADN) is a UML-based information modeling language that defines
data structure independently of data format. This Committee Note
describes the use of IMs, explains how to construct IMs using
JADN, and contrasts IMs with other modeling approaches, such as
Entity-Relationship models for databases, and knowledge models /
ontologies.

### :left_speech_bubble:   Further Description of this Repository :left_speech_bubble: 

This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a
formal specification that describes _Information Modeling With
JADN_. This GitHub repository supports development of the content
and change tracking for the _Information Modeling With JADN_ as
new working draft level revisions are created and the associated
CSDs mature.
